# Supermarket-Console-POS


The repo contains a Supermarket Point of Sales Console Application.
I designed and developed the application during my training period as my final project at Capgemini Technology Services.
The project use case was for training purposes only and the entire code was not used for any kind of production environment. 
This project is put hear to showcase my skillset as a C++ software engineer. 
This project was designed and developed in July 2015.
