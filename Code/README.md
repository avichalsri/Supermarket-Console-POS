The folder Code/SUPERMARKET contains a Visual Studio 2017 project which can be directly opened.

1. include folder contains all the header files
2. Src folder contains all the implementation files files
3. resources contains the database files with the extension .supermarket. These files are required to be in the same folder and should not be changed or deleted for proper functioning of the Application.

After building the project, the SUPERMARKET.exe can be found in the Src folder. One can run the .exe directly from there.

The entire code base was designed and developed in 70 hours. 
I did not get the opportunity to test it thoroughly and correct some known issues. 
There might be some design as well as implementation flaws in it, let me know to discuss how the design could be made better or to just point out the flaws in the design and/or code.
